### What did I learn? [ABOUT PROGRAMMING]
This was my first official solo software project, I learned quite a bit.
Here's what I delved into:
- Javascript
- Bootstrap
- HTML/CSS
### What did I learn? [ABOUT WRITING SOFTWARE]
- Removing deprecated code. As long as I effectively use a version control system (GitHub in this case), my code will not be lost. Deprecated code clutters my current workspace
- Choosing variable names wisely. Though this was a solo project, I found myself forgetting functionality of poorly named variables
